## 1. Security Philosophy

### 1.1 Privacy-First Architecture

VaulType is designed from the ground up with a single, unwavering principle: **your voice data never leaves your device**. Every architectural decision flows from this commitment.

The core speech-to-text pipeline operates entirely on-device using [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for speech recognition and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) for optional LLM post-processing. Both engines leverage Apple Metal for GPU acceleration and require zero network connectivity.

> 🔒 **Security**: VaulType can function with all network interfaces disabled. Core STT functionality requires only microphone access and a local ML model — nothing else.

│  │  NO network calls · NO cloud APIs · NO telemetry │   │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1.2 Zero-Trust-Cloud Model

VaulType adopts a zero-trust approach toward cloud services:

- **No cloud STT APIs**: Unlike Whisper API, Google Speech-to-Text, or Azure Cognitive Services, VaulType never transmits audio to external servers.
- **No analytics or telemetry**: No usage data, no crash reports (unless explicitly opted in by the user), no feature flags fetched from remote servers.
- **No account system**: VaulType does not require user registration, authentication tokens, or any form of identity.
- **No remote configuration**: All settings are stored locally. The app never fetches configuration from a remote server.

> ℹ️ **Info**: The only network activity that can occur is explicitly user-initiated (model downloads, update checks, optional crash reporting). See [Section 2: Network Security](#2-network-security) for the complete inventory.

### 1.3 Defense in Depth

VaulType employs multiple layers of security:

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Architecture** | Local-only processing, no cloud dependencies |
| **Memory** | Audio buffers zeroed after processing, no persistent audio storage by default |
| **Storage** | macOS FileVault encryption, Keychain for secrets, app container isolation |
| **Code** | Hardened runtime, code signing, notarization |
| **Dependencies** | Pinned versions, source audits, minimal dependency surface |
| **Permissions** | Principle of least privilege, only requested permissions are used |
| **User Control** | Granular opt-in for any network feature, full transparency |

---

## 2. Network Security

### 2.1 Core Functionality: Zero Network

VaulType's core speech-to-text pipeline makes **zero network requests**. The following features operate entirely offline:

- Audio capture and processing
- Speech-to-text transcription (whisper.cpp)
- LLM post-processing (llama.cpp)
- Text injection via Accessibility API
- Clipboard-based paste operations
- Voice command execution
- All user settings and preferences

> ✅ **Do**: Verify VaulType's offline capability by disabling all network interfaces. Core STT functionality will continue to work without interruption.

### 2.2 Network Endpoint Inventory

The following table is a **complete and exhaustive** list of all network endpoints VaulType may contact. Any network activity not listed here is a bug and should be reported immediately.

| Endpoint | Purpose | When Contacted | User Control | Protocol |
|----------|---------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| `huggingface.co` | ML model downloads | User-initiated only (clicking "Download Model") | Fully opt-in; never automatic | HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) |
| `cdn-lfs.huggingface.co` | ML model file CDN | During model downloads (redirected from huggingface.co) | Fully opt-in; part of model download flow | HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) |
| `sparkle-project.org` / custom feed URL | Sparkle update checks | Configurable: automatic, manual, or disabled | Settings > Updates > Check Frequency | HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) |
| `*.ingest.sentry.io` | Crash reporting | Only if user explicitly enables crash reporting | Settings > Privacy > Send Crash Reports (default: **OFF**) | HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) |

> ⚠️ **Warning**: If you observe any network requests to endpoints not listed in this table, this is a potential security issue. Please report it immediately via our [Responsible Disclosure Policy](#12-responsible-disclosure-policy).

### 2.3 Network Monitoring & Verification

Users and auditors can verify VaulType's network behavior:

```bash
# Monitor all VaulType network connections in real-time
sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep VaulType

# Use Little Snitch, LuLu, or similar tools
# to verify no unexpected outbound connections

# Use tcpdump to capture all VaulType traffic on a specific interface
sudo tcpdump -i en0 -n proc VaulType

# Verify with nettop
nettop -p $(pgrep VaulType) -J bytes_in,bytes_out
```

> 💡 **Tip**: For maximum assurance, use a network-level firewall like [LuLu](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html) (free, open source) to block all VaulType network access. Core functionality will remain fully operational.

### 2.4 Certificate Pinning

For the limited network operations that do occur:

- **Sparkle updates**: Sparkle uses EdDSA (Ed25519) signature verification for update packages. The public key is embedded in the app at build time. Even if a TLS connection were compromised, unsigned or incorrectly signed updates would be rejected.
- **Model downloads**: Downloads from Hugging Face are verified via SHA-256 checksums published in model repository metadata. Checksums are compared after download.
- **Sentry (opt-in)**: Uses the official Sentry SDK with default TLS certificate validation.

```swift
// Example: Model download integrity verification
func verifyModelIntegrity(at path: URL, expectedSHA256: String) throws -> Bool {
    let fileData = try Data(contentsOf: path)
    let digest = SHA256.hash(data: fileData)
    let hashString = digest.compactMap { String(format: "%02x", $0) }.joined()

    guard hashString == expectedSHA256 else {
        try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: path)
        throw ModelError.integrityCheckFailed(
            expected: expectedSHA256,
            actual: hashString
        )
    }
    return true
}
```

---

## 3. Audio Data Security

### 3.1 Audio Capture Pipeline

Audio is captured using Apple's `AVAudioEngine` framework and processed in-memory with strict lifecycle controls:

```swift
// Audio capture configuration — minimal buffer, mono channel, 16kHz for whisper.cpp
let inputFormat = AVAudioFormat(
    commonFormat: .pcmFormatFloat32,
    sampleRate: 16000.0,
    channels: 1,
    interleaved: false
)

audioEngine.inputNode.installTap(
    onBus: 0,
    bufferSize: 4096,  // ~256ms of audio per buffer
    format: inputFormat
) { [weak self] buffer, time in
    // Buffer is processed in-memory only
    self?.processAudioBuffer(buffer)
    // Buffer is released by ARC — no disk writes
}
```

> 🔒 **Security**: Audio data exists only as transient `AVAudioPCMBuffer` objects in process memory. These buffers are consumed by whisper.cpp inference and immediately discarded. At no point in the default pipeline is audio data written to the filesystem.

### 3.2 Memory Handling

VaulType implements explicit memory hygiene for audio data:

```swift
/// Securely clears audio buffer contents after processing
func securelyReleaseAudioBuffer(_ buffer: AVAudioPCMBuffer) {
    guard let channelData = buffer.floatChannelData else { return }
    let frameCount = Int(buffer.frameLength)

    for channel in 0..<Int(buffer.format.channelCount) {
        // Zero the audio samples to prevent memory forensics recovery
        memset_s(
            channelData[channel],
            frameCount * MemoryLayout<Float>.stride,
            0,
            frameCount * MemoryLayout<Float>.stride
        )
    }
}
```

Key memory security properties:

- **Buffer zeroing**: Audio sample buffers are explicitly zeroed with `memset_s` (which cannot be optimized away by the compiler) after whisper.cpp processing completes.
- **No swap protection**: macOS may swap process memory to disk. We mitigate this by relying on FileVault full-disk encryption (see [Section 4](#4-data-at-rest)) and by processing audio in small, short-lived buffers.
- **No memory mapping of audio**: Audio data is never memory-mapped from files; it exists only as heap-allocated buffers.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: If the user enables **transcription history**, the resulting text (not audio) is stored in the SwiftData database. Audio is never persisted, even when history is enabled.

### 3.3 Audio Data Lifecycle

```

       ▼
 AVAudioEngine Tap (in-memory buffer, ~256ms)

       │
       ▼
 Buffer zeroed via memset_s()
       │
       ▼

```

| Stage | Data Form | Duration | Persisted? |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Capture | PCM Float32 samples | ~256ms per buffer | Never |
| Inference | Internal whisper.cpp state | Duration of transcription | Never |
| Output | UTF-8 text string | Until injected | Only if history is enabled |
| Post-processing | llama.cpp internal state | Duration of LLM pass | Never |
| Cleanup | Zeroed memory | Instant | N/A |

---

## 4. Data at Rest

### 4.1 SwiftData Database

VaulType uses SwiftData for persistent storage of user preferences and optional transcription history.

**Storage location:**
```
~/Library/Containers/com.vaultype.app/Data/Library/Application Support/
```

If running outside of the App Sandbox (required for Accessibility API):
```
~/Library/Application Support/VaulType/
```

**What is stored:**

| Data | Stored? | Encryption | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| User preferences | Yes | FileVault | Theme, shortcuts, model selection |
| Transcription history | Opt-in | FileVault | Text only, never audio |
| Model download metadata | Yes | FileVault | File paths, checksums, download dates |
| Audio recordings | **Never** | N/A | Audio is never written to disk |
| API keys / tokens | **Never** | N/A | No cloud services used |

> 🍎 **macOS-specific**: SwiftData databases in the app container are protected by macOS Data Protection and FileVault full-disk encryption when enabled. VaulType strongly recommends FileVault be enabled (see [Section 13](#13-security-best-practices-for-users)).

### 4.2 Keychain Usage

Sensitive configuration values are stored in the macOS Keychain rather than in UserDefaults or plaintext files:

```swift
// Keychain storage for sensitive settings
enum KeychainItem: String {
    case sparkleEdDSAPublicKey = "com.vaultype.sparkle.eddsaPublicKey"
    case sentryDSN = "com.vaultype.sentry.dsn"  // Only if crash reporting opted in
}

func storeInKeychain(item: KeychainItem, data: Data) throws {
    let query: [String: Any] = [
        kSecClass as String: kSecClassGenericPassword,
        kSecAttrService as String: item.rawValue,
        kSecAttrAccount as String: "VaulType",
        kSecValueData as String: data,
        kSecAttrAccessible as String: kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly
    ]

    let status = SecItemAdd(query as CFDictionary, nil)
    guard status == errSecSuccess || status == errSecDuplicateItem else {
        throw KeychainError.unableToStore(status: status)
    }
}
```

> 🔒 **Security**: Keychain items use `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`, which ensures they are available only when the device is unlocked and are never included in backups or synced to other devices.

### 4.3 Temporary Files

VaulType avoids temporary files for audio data. The only temporary files created are:

| Temporary File | Purpose | Lifetime | Cleanup |
|----------------|---------|----------|---------|
| Model download `.part` files | Partial model downloads | During download | Deleted on completion or failure |
| Sparkle update DMG/ZIP | App update packages | During update | Deleted by Sparkle after install |

```swift
// Temporary file cleanup on app launch
func cleanStaleTempFiles() {
    let tempDir = FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory
        .appendingPathComponent("VaulType", isDirectory: true)

    if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: tempDir.path) {
        try? FileManager.default.removeItem(at: tempDir)
    }
}
```

### 4.4 Model Files

ML model files (`.gguf` format for both whisper.cpp and llama.cpp) are stored locally:

```
~/Library/Application Support/VaulType/Models/
├── whisper/
│   └── ggml-base.en.bin          # Whisper STT model
└── llama/
    └── Meta-Llama-3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf  # LLM post-processing model
```

**Model file security considerations:**

- Models are downloaded over HTTPS from Hugging Face with SHA-256 integrity verification.
- Models are read-only after download; VaulType does not modify model files.
- Models do not contain executable code — they are weight tensors loaded by whisper.cpp/llama.cpp.
- Model files should be treated as untrusted input; both whisper.cpp and llama.cpp include input validation for GGUF/GGML file parsing.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Users who manually place model files (e.g., downloaded from third-party sources) bypass integrity verification. Only models downloaded through VaulType's built-in model manager are checksum-verified. See [Threat Model: Malicious Model Files](#101-threat-matrix).

---

## 5. Text Injection Security

### 5.1 CGEvent Text Injection

VaulType injects transcribed text into the active application using macOS Accessibility APIs via `CGEvent`:

```swift
func injectTextViaCGEvent(_ text: String) {
    for character in text {
        let utf16 = Array(String(character).utf16)

        let keyDown = CGEvent(keyboardEventSource: nil, virtualKey: 0, keyDown: true)
        keyDown?.keyboardSetUnicodeString(stringLength: utf16.count, unicodeString: utf16)
        keyDown?.post(tap: .cghidEventTap)

        let keyUp = CGEvent(keyboardEventSource: nil, virtualKey: 0, keyDown: false)
        keyUp?.keyboardSetUnicodeString(stringLength: utf16.count, unicodeString: utf16)
        keyUp?.post(tap: .cghidEventTap)
    }
}
```

**Security properties of CGEvent injection:**

- Requires explicit Accessibility permission granted by the user in System Settings.
- Events are posted at the HID (Human Interface Device) level, simulating real keyboard input.
- The target application receives standard keyboard events — no special APIs or hooks are involved.
- CGEvent injection is rate-limited by the system to prevent event flooding.

> 🍎 **macOS-specific**: CGEvent injection requires the calling process to be listed in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility. This permission survives app restarts but must be re-granted after app updates that change the code signature.

### 5.2 Clipboard Operations

For long text blocks or text containing special characters that CGEvent handles poorly, VaulType offers a clipboard-based paste fallback:

```swift
func injectTextViaClipboard(_ text: String) {
    let pasteboard = NSPasteboard.general

    // 1. Preserve the current clipboard contents
    let previousContents = pasteboard.pasteboardItems?.compactMap { item -> NSPasteboardItem? in
        let preserved = NSPasteboardItem()
        for type in item.types {
            if let data = item.data(forType: type) {
                preserved.setData(data, forType: type)
            }
        }
        return preserved
    }

    // 2. Set the transcribed text
    pasteboard.clearContents()
    pasteboard.setString(text, forType: .string)

    // 3. Simulate Cmd+V paste
    let cmdVDown = CGEvent(keyboardEventSource: nil, virtualKey: 0x09, keyDown: true) // 'v'
    cmdVDown?.flags = .maskCommand
    cmdVDown?.post(tap: .cghidEventTap)

    let cmdVUp = CGEvent(keyboardEventSource: nil, virtualKey: 0x09, keyDown: false)
    cmdVUp?.flags = .maskCommand
    cmdVUp?.post(tap: .cghidEventTap)

    // 4. Restore the original clipboard after a short delay
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.15) {
        pasteboard.clearContents()
        if let previousContents {
            pasteboard.writeObjects(previousContents)
        }
    }
}
```

### 5.3 Known Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Description | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Clipboard snooping** | Medium | Clipboard managers (e.g., Paste, Maccy) may capture transcribed text during the brief window (~150ms) where it occupies the clipboard. | VaulType restores the original clipboard within 150ms. Use CGEvent injection (default) instead of clipboard paste for sensitive content. Consider documenting clipboard manager exclusions. |
| **Clipboard history exposure** | Low | Some clipboard managers maintain persistent history databases that may retain briefly pasted content. | Users handling sensitive transcriptions should prefer CGEvent injection mode or configure their clipboard manager to exclude VaulType. |
| **Injected text visibility** | Low | Other processes with Accessibility permissions could observe injected keystrokes. | This is a fundamental property of the macOS Accessibility system; it cannot be mitigated at the application level. Users should audit which apps have Accessibility permissions. |
| **Race condition on paste** | Low | If the user copies something to the clipboard during the 150ms paste window, that content will be overwritten by the clipboard restore operation. | The 150ms window is intentionally short. A future enhancement could use `NSPasteboard.changeCount` to detect external clipboard changes. |

> ❌ **Don't**: Do not use clipboard paste mode for highly sensitive content (e.g., passwords, medical records). Prefer CGEvent injection, which bypasses the clipboard entirely.

> ✅ **Do**: Use CGEvent injection (the default mode) for most text injection. It is both more secure and more reliable than clipboard-based paste.

## 6. macOS Permissions & Entitlements

### 6.1 Required Permissions

VaulType requests only the permissions strictly necessary for its functionality:

| Permission | System Prompt | Why Required | Revocable? |
|------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **Microphone** | "VaulType would like to access the microphone" | Audio capture for speech-to-text via AVAudioEngine | Yes, in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone |
| **Accessibility** | Listed in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility | CGEvent text injection into target applications | Yes, by toggling off in System Settings |
| **Automation** (optional) | "VaulType wants to control [App]" | AppleScript-based voice commands (e.g., "open Safari") | Yes, per-app in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation |

> 🍎 **macOS-specific**: VaulType will function in a degraded mode if Microphone or Accessibility permissions are denied. The app will guide the user to grant permissions but will never attempt to circumvent macOS permission controls.

### 6.2 Entitlements Breakdown

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <!-- Audio capture for speech-to-text -->
    <key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
    <true/>

    <!-- Hardened runtime: allow unsigned executable memory for whisper.cpp/llama.cpp JIT -->
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
    <true/>

    <!-- Hardened runtime: allow loading third-party libraries (whisper.cpp, llama.cpp) -->
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
    <true/>

    <!-- Hardened runtime: allow DYLD environment variables (development only) -->
    <!-- REMOVED in release builds -->
    <!-- <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables</key> -->
    <!-- <true/> -->
</dict>
</plist>
```

**Entitlement-by-entitlement justification:**

| Entitlement | Justification | Risk | Mitigation |
|-------------|---------------|------|------------|
| `device.audio-input` | Required for AVAudioEngine microphone access. Without this, no audio capture is possible. | Microphone access | Permission gated by macOS; user must explicitly grant. App clearly shows recording state via menu bar indicator. |
| `cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory` | whisper.cpp and llama.cpp use Metal compute shaders and may allocate executable memory for optimized inference paths. | Potential code injection vector | Hardened runtime still active for all other code. Only the ML inference engine uses this entitlement. |
| `cs.disable-library-validation` | Required to load whisper.cpp and llama.cpp dynamic libraries that are not signed with the same Team ID. | Library injection | Libraries are bundled within the signed app bundle and verified during notarization. |

> ⚠️ **Warning**: The `cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` entitlement is **never** included in release builds. It is only used during development for debugging purposes. CI/CD pipelines validate its absence before signing release builds.

### 6.3 Principle of Least Privilege

VaulType follows the principle of least privilege rigorously:

- **No Full Disk Access**: VaulType does not request or require Full Disk Access.
- **No Screen Recording**: VaulType does not capture screen content.
- **No Camera**: VaulType does not access the camera.
- **No Contacts / Calendars / Reminders**: No personal data access.
- **No Location**: No location services.
- **No Network (for core features)**: Network is only used for optional, user-initiated features.
- **Automation is optional**: Voice commands using AppleScript are opt-in and per-application.

> 🔒 **Security**: Users should regularly audit which applications have Accessibility and Microphone permissions in System Settings > Privacy & Security. Remove permissions from any application you no longer use.

## 7. Code Signing & Notarization

### 7.1 Developer ID Signing

All VaulType releases are signed with a valid Apple Developer ID:

```bash
# Verify code signature of VaulType.app
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=4 /Applications/VaulType.app

# Display signing details
codesign -dv --verbose=4 /Applications/VaulType.app

# Expected output includes:
# Authority=Developer ID Application: [Developer Name] ([Team ID])
# Authority=Developer ID Certification Authority
# Authority=Apple Root CA
# Flags=0x10000(runtime)      <-- Hardened Runtime enabled
```

All binaries within the app bundle are signed, including:

- `VaulType.app/Contents/MacOS/VaulType` (main executable)
- `VaulType.app/Contents/Frameworks/libwhisper.dylib`
- `VaulType.app/Contents/Frameworks/libllama.dylib`
- `VaulType.app/Contents/Frameworks/Sparkle.framework`

### 7.2 Notarization

Every release build is submitted to Apple's notarization service:

```bash
# Notarization submission (performed by CI/CD)
xcrun notarytool submit VaulType.dmg \
    --apple-id "$APPLE_ID" \
    --team-id "$TEAM_ID" \
    --password "$APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD" \
    --wait

# Staple the notarization ticket to the DMG
xcrun stapler staple VaulType.dmg

# Verify notarization
spctl --assess --verbose=4 --type execute /Applications/VaulType.app
# Expected: /Applications/VaulType.app: accepted
# source=Notarized Developer ID
```

Notarization ensures:
- Apple has scanned the binary for known malware.
- The binary has not been tampered with since signing.
- Gatekeeper will allow the app to run without warning on macOS.

### 7.3 Hardened Runtime

VaulType enables the Hardened Runtime, which provides the following protections:

| Protection | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Code signature enforcement | Enabled | App will not launch if signature is invalid |
| Library validation | Partially disabled | Required for whisper.cpp/llama.cpp; see entitlements |
| DYLD environment variable restrictions | Enabled (release) | Prevents library injection via environment |
| Debugging restrictions | Enabled (release) | Prevents unauthorized debugger attachment |
| Memory protection | Partially relaxed | `allow-unsigned-executable-memory` for ML inference |
| Resource access control | Enabled | Microphone access gated by entitlement + user permission |

> ℹ️ **Info**: The hardened runtime exceptions (`allow-unsigned-executable-memory` and `disable-library-validation`) are the minimum required for local ML inference with whisper.cpp and llama.cpp. These entitlements are reviewed during Apple's notarization process.

---

## 8. Third-Party Dependency Audit

### 8.1 Dependency Inventory

| Dependency | Version Policy | License | Purpose | Network Access? | Security Track Record |
|------------|---------------|---------|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **whisper.cpp** | Pinned to tested commit hash | MIT | Speech-to-text inference engine | None | Active maintainer (Georgi Gerganov), regular security patches, widely audited by community |
| **llama.cpp** | Pinned to tested commit hash | MIT | LLM post-processing inference engine | None | Same maintainer as whisper.cpp, extensive community review, used in production by multiple companies |
| **Sparkle** | Latest stable release (2.x) | MIT | App update framework | Yes (update checks) | Long-standing macOS update framework, EdDSA signature verification, well-audited |
| **Sentry SDK** (optional) | Latest stable release | MIT | Crash reporting (opt-in only) | Yes (crash reports) | Widely used, SOC 2 certified, data can be self-hosted |
| **Swift Argument Parser** | Latest stable release | Apache 2.0 | CLI argument parsing (if applicable) | None | Apple-maintained |
| **KeyboardShortcuts** | Latest stable release | MIT | Global hotkey management | None | Well-maintained, small codebase |

### 8.2 Supply Chain Security

VaulType takes the following steps to secure its dependency supply chain:

- **Pinned versions**: All dependencies are pinned to specific versions or commit hashes in `Package.swift`. No floating version ranges for security-critical dependencies.
- **Source review**: Major version updates of whisper.cpp and llama.cpp are reviewed before adoption, with particular attention to GGUF/GGML file parsing code.
- **Swift Package Manager**: Dependencies are fetched via SPM with checksum verification.
- **No binary dependencies**: All C/C++ dependencies (whisper.cpp, llama.cpp) are compiled from source as part of the build process, ensuring full auditability.

```swift
// Package.swift — Pinned dependency example
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp",
        exact: "1.7.3"  // Pinned to audited version
    ),
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle",
        exact: "2.6.4"  // Pinned to audited version
    ),
]
```

> ❌ **Don't**: Never use `.upToNextMajor()` or `.branch("main")` for security-critical dependencies. Always pin to an exact version or commit hash that has been reviewed.

### 8.3 Update Policy

| Dependency | Update Frequency | Review Process |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| whisper.cpp | Every 2-4 weeks | Review GGML parser changes, test with model suite, verify Metal compatibility |
| llama.cpp | Every 2-4 weeks | Review GGUF parser changes, test post-processing pipeline, verify Metal compatibility |
| Sparkle | On security releases | Review changelog for security fixes, test update flow |
| Sentry SDK | Quarterly | Review changelog, verify no new data collection behaviors |

## 9. Sandboxing Analysis

### 9.1 App Sandbox Limitations

VaulType **cannot use the full macOS App Sandbox** due to its core functionality requirements:

| Feature | Sandbox Compatibility | Reason |
|---------|----------------------|--------|
| Accessibility API (CGEvent) | Incompatible | App Sandbox prohibits CGEvent injection. The `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.apple-events` entitlement is insufficient — full Accessibility access requires running outside the sandbox or using a privileged helper. |
| AVAudioEngine (Microphone) | Compatible | Works within sandbox with `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` entitlement. |
| SwiftData / File Access | Compatible | Works within sandbox using app container. |
| Metal GPU Compute | Compatible | Works within sandbox. |
| AppleScript Automation | Partially compatible | Requires `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` and per-app consent prompts. Limited in sandbox. |

> 🍎 **macOS-specific**: The Accessibility API (`AXUIElement`, `CGEvent`) is fundamentally incompatible with the App Sandbox. This is a well-known limitation acknowledged by Apple. Apps that require Accessibility-based text injection (including all third-party text expanders and keyboard macro tools) must run without the App Sandbox.

### 9.2 Distribution Tradeoffs

| Distribution Method | App Sandbox | Accessibility API | Auto-Update | Gatekeeper | Notes |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Mac App Store** | Required | Not possible (standard sandbox) | Via App Store | Yes | Would require removing core text injection functionality |
| **Direct (Developer ID + Notarization)** | Not required | Full support | Via Sparkle | Yes (notarized) | **VaulType's chosen distribution method** |
| **Direct (unsigned)** | Not required | Full support | Manual | No (Gatekeeper warning) | Not recommended; requires user to bypass Gatekeeper |

VaulType is distributed directly via Developer ID signing and notarization. This provides:
- Full Accessibility API support for text injection
- Gatekeeper approval via notarization (no security warnings)
- Automatic updates via Sparkle with EdDSA signature verification
- User trust via Apple's notarization malware scan

### 9.3 Compensating Controls

Since VaulType cannot use the App Sandbox, the following compensating security controls are in place:

1. **Hardened Runtime**: Enables most sandbox-like protections (code injection prevention, library validation, debugger restrictions) without the full sandbox.
2. **Minimal file system access**: VaulType only reads/writes to its own Application Support directory and the user-selected model storage directory.
3. **No network access for core features**: Eliminates the largest attack surface that sandboxing typically protects against.
4. **Principle of least privilege**: Only the entitlements strictly required for functionality are included.
5. **Notarization**: Apple scans the binary for malware before distribution.
6. **Open source (GPL-3.0)**: The full source code is available for audit, providing transparency that closed-source sandboxed apps cannot offer.

> ℹ️ **Info**: For a detailed discussion of VaulType's architecture and the rationale behind these design decisions, see [Architecture](/docs/architecture/overview/).

## 10. Threat Model

### 10.1 Threat Matrix

| # | Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|---|--------|-----------|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| T1 | **Malicious model files** — Crafted GGUF/GGML files exploiting parser vulnerabilities in whisper.cpp or llama.cpp | Low | High | High | SHA-256 integrity checks on downloaded models. Only official Hugging Face repositories used. Users warned about manually placed models. Parser hardening upstream. | Mitigated |
| T2 | **Clipboard snooping** — Third-party clipboard managers capturing transcribed text during paste operations | Medium | Medium | Medium | CGEvent injection (default) bypasses clipboard entirely. Clipboard restore within 150ms for paste mode. Users advised to exclude VaulType from clipboard managers. | Partially mitigated |
| T3 | **Audio eavesdropping via compromised microphone permission** — Malware leveraging VaulType's microphone access | Low | High | Medium | VaulType does not expose audio to other processes. Microphone permission is per-app in macOS. macOS shows orange dot indicator when mic is active. Audio never leaves process memory. | Mitigated |
| T4 | **Supply chain compromise** — Malicious code injected into whisper.cpp, llama.cpp, or Sparkle dependencies | Low | Critical | High | Pinned dependency versions, source code review for updates, compiled from source (no binary dependencies), notarization scan by Apple. | Mitigated |
| T5 | **Update hijacking** — Man-in-the-middle attack on Sparkle update channel | Low | Critical | High | Sparkle uses EdDSA (Ed25519) signatures. Public key embedded at build time. Even compromised HTTPS cannot inject unsigned updates. | Mitigated |
| T6 | **Accessibility API abuse** — A compromised VaulType process using Accessibility permissions to control other apps | Very Low | Critical | Medium | Hardened runtime prevents code injection. Code signing prevents binary tampering. Notarization validates at distribution. macOS kernel enforces code signature at runtime. | Mitigated |
| T7 | **Memory forensics** — Extracting audio data from process memory or swap | Very Low | High | Low | Audio buffers zeroed with `memset_s` after processing. FileVault encrypts swap. Small buffer sizes minimize exposure window. | Mitigated |
| T8 | **Transcription history exposure** — Unauthorized access to SwiftData database containing transcription history | Low | Medium | Medium | Database stored in app container with macOS file permissions. FileVault encrypts at rest. History is opt-in (disabled by default). Users can purge history. | Mitigated |
| T9 | **Keystroke injection manipulation** — Malicious process altering CGEvent stream | Very Low | Medium | Low | CGEvents are posted at HID level. The sending process (VaulType) is code-signed. No inter-process channel for injection manipulation. | Mitigated |
| T10 | **Denial of service via microphone monopolization** — VaulType holding exclusive mic access | Low | Low | Low | AVAudioEngine uses shared mic access by default. Other apps can capture audio simultaneously. VaulType releases mic when not actively transcribing. | Mitigated |

```

### 10.3 Out-of-Scope Threats

The following threats are considered out of scope for VaulType's threat model, as they require a fundamentally compromised system:

- **Kernel-level rootkits**: A compromised kernel can intercept any process's memory, audio, or keystrokes regardless of application-level mitigations.
- **Physical access attacks**: An attacker with physical access to an unlocked Mac can access any running application's data.
- **Compromised macOS TCC database**: If the TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) database is tampered with, permission controls are ineffective.
- **Hardware-level microphone taps**: Physical microphone interception is outside software control.
- **Side-channel attacks on Metal GPU**: Theoretical GPU memory leakage between processes during Metal compute operations.

## 13. Security Best Practices for Users

### 13.1 System-Level Recommendations

| Recommendation | Priority | How |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| **Enable FileVault** | Critical | System Settings > Privacy & Security > FileVault > Turn On. Encrypts your entire disk, protecting all VaulType data at rest. |
| **Keep macOS updated** | Critical | System Settings > General > Software Update. Security patches protect the TCC framework, kernel, and audio subsystem that VaulType depends on. |
| **Use a strong login password** | Critical | Your macOS login password protects FileVault encryption and Keychain access. |
| **Audit Accessibility permissions** | High | System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility. Remove apps you no longer use. Any app with Accessibility permission can inject keystrokes and observe UI elements. |
| **Audit Microphone permissions** | High | System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone. Remove apps that should not have microphone access. |
| **Use a firewall** | Medium | System Settings > Network > Firewall > Turn On. Or use a third-party firewall like LuLu for per-app network control. |
| **Enable Lockdown Mode** (if applicable) | Optional | System Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode. Note: This may affect VaulType's ability to load ML models. Test before enabling in production use. |

### 13.2 VaulType-Specific Recommendations

| Recommendation | Priority | How |
|----------------|----------|-----|
| **Use CGEvent injection (default)** | High | Prefer CGEvent over clipboard paste for text injection. CGEvent never touches the clipboard. |
| **Disable transcription history for sensitive work** | High | Settings > Privacy > Transcription History > Off. When disabled, no text is persisted after injection. |
| **Download models only through VaulType** | High | Use the built-in model manager (Settings > Models > Download). This ensures SHA-256 integrity verification. |
| **Review Sparkle update settings** | Medium | Settings > Updates. Choose between automatic checks, manual checks, or disabled. |
| **Keep crash reporting opt-in conscious** | Medium | Settings > Privacy > Send Crash Reports. Default is OFF. Only enable if you want to help improve VaulType and are comfortable sharing crash data with Sentry. |
| **Purge transcription history regularly** | Medium | Settings > Privacy > Clear History. If you use transcription history, clear it periodically. |
| **Exclude VaulType from clipboard managers** | Medium | If you use a clipboard manager (Paste, Maccy, etc.), add VaulType to its exclusion list to prevent it from capturing brief clipboard operations during paste-mode injection. |

### 13.3 Verifying Installation Integrity

After downloading VaulType, verify the installation is authentic and untampered:

```bash
# 1. Verify code signature
codesign --verify --deep --strict /Applications/VaulType.app
# Expected: valid on disk

# 2. Verify notarization
spctl --assess --verbose=4 --type execute /Applications/VaulType.app
# Expected: accepted / source=Notarized Developer ID

# 3. Check the signing authority
codesign -dv /Applications/VaulType.app 2>&1 | grep "Authority"
# Expected: Three lines showing Developer ID → Apple chain

# 4. Verify no modifications since signing
codesign --verify --verbose=4 /Applications/VaulType.app 2>&1 | grep "valid"
# Expected: "valid on disk" and "satisfies its Designated Requirement"
```

> 💡 **Tip**: If any of the above commands report errors, do **not** run the application. Re-download VaulType from the official source and verify again.

```bash
# Optional: Compare SHA-256 of the downloaded DMG against published checksums
shasum -a 256 ~/Downloads/VaulType-*.dmg
# Compare output against checksums published on the GitHub Releases page
```

## General

### What is VaulType?

VaulType is a privacy-first, macOS-native speech-to-text application that lets you dictate text into any app where your cursor is active. It uses local AI models (whisper.cpp for speech recognition and llama.cpp for text post-processing) — nothing ever leaves your Mac.

### Why is it called VaulType?

The name captures the core philosophy:
- **Hush** — Your voice stays private, never leaving your device
- **Type** — Text appears at your cursor, as if you typed it

### Is VaulType free?

Yes. VaulType is open source under the GPL-3.0 license. It's free to download, use, and modify.

### What languages does VaulType support?

VaulType supports **90+ languages** through Whisper's multilingual models (small, medium, large-v3), including English, Turkish, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and many more. English-only models are also available for faster performance. Language can be auto-detected or manually selected.

### Does VaulType work offline?

**Yes, 100%.** VaulType is designed to work completely offline. All speech recognition and text processing happen locally on your Mac. The only network requests are:
- Model downloads (one-time, optional)
- Auto-update checks via Sparkle (can be disabled)

---

## Privacy & Security

### Is my audio sent to the cloud?

**No, absolutely not.** VaulType processes all audio locally using whisper.cpp. Your voice data never leaves your Mac. There is no cloud component, no API calls, and no telemetry.

### Is my dictation text stored anywhere?

By default, **no**. Text is transcribed, optionally processed by the LLM, and injected at your cursor — then discarded from memory. If you enable Dictation History (opt-in), transcriptions are stored locally in SwiftData on your Mac.

### Does VaulType collect any data?

**No.** VaulType has zero telemetry, zero analytics, and zero data collection by default. If you opt in to crash reporting (Sentry), only crash logs are sent — never audio, text, or usage data.

### Is it safe to use for sensitive work?

Yes. Since everything is local, VaulType is suitable for sensitive work including:
- Legal documents
- Medical notes
- Confidential business communications
- Personal journaling

> 🔒 VaulType cannot inject text into password fields — this is a deliberate security measure.

### What permissions does VaulType need and why?

| Permission | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| **Accessibility** | To inject text into the active app via CGEvent |
| **Microphone** | To capture your voice for speech recognition |
| **Automation** (optional) | For voice commands that control other apps via AppleScript |

See [PERMISSIONS.md](/docs/features/permissions/) for a detailed breakdown.

## Hardware & Compatibility

### Which Mac do I need?

VaulType runs on any Mac with **macOS 14.0 (Sonoma)** or later:

- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)** — Recommended. Metal GPU acceleration makes speech recognition 3-10x faster.
- **Intel Macs** — Supported with CPU-only inference. Use smaller models (tiny, base) for acceptable speed.

### How much RAM do I need?

| Configuration | Minimum RAM |
|--------------|-------------|
| Whisper tiny (Raw mode) | 8 GB |
| Whisper small (Raw mode) | 8 GB |
| Whisper small + LLM 3B | 16 GB |
| Whisper medium + LLM 3B | 16 GB |
| Whisper large-v3 + LLM | 32 GB |

> 💡 **Recommendation:** 16 GB for the best experience with both STT and LLM features.

### How much disk space do models need?

| Model | Size |
|-------|------|
| Whisper tiny | ~75 MB |
| Whisper base | ~142 MB |
| Whisper small | ~466 MB |
| Whisper medium | ~1.5 GB |
| Whisper large-v3 | ~3.0 GB |
| Qwen2.5-3B Q4 | ~2.0 GB |
| Phi-3.5-mini Q4 | ~2.5 GB |

You only need one Whisper model and optionally one LLM. Typical installation: **500 MB to 3 GB**.

### Does it work on macOS Sequoia?

Yes. VaulType is tested on macOS 14 (Sonoma) and macOS 15 (Sequoia).

## Features

### Can I use VaulType with Claude Code?

**Yes!** This is one of VaulType's best use cases. Use **Prompt Mode** to dictate into your terminal, and VaulType will automatically format your messy speech into clear, well-structured prompts for Claude Code.

Example: You say *"I want to refactor the authentication module to use JWT tokens instead of sessions and add proper error handling"* and VaulType formats it into a clean, structured prompt before injecting it into the terminal.

### Does it work in Terminal?

**Yes.** VaulType injects text into any macOS app, including Terminal.app, iTerm2, Warp, Alacritty, and Kitty. Use the Clipboard injection method for the best terminal compatibility.

### What are the processing modes?

| Mode | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| **Raw** | No LLM processing — inject speech exactly as recognized |
| **Clean** | Fix spelling, grammar, punctuation, capitalization |
| **Structure** | Format as bullet lists, numbered steps, or tables |
| **Prompt** | Reformat into clear, well-structured AI prompts |
| **Code** | Format as code comments, commit messages, docstrings |
| **Custom** | Your own prompt templates for any formatting need |

### Can I create custom processing modes?

Yes. VaulType has a full prompt template system. You can:
- Write custom system and user prompts
- Use variables like `{text}`, `{language}`, `{app_name}`, `{context}`
- Import and export templates
- Assign modes to specific hotkeys or apps

### Does VaulType support push-to-talk?

Yes, two modes are available:
- **Push-to-talk** — Hold the hotkey to record, release to process
- **Toggle mode** — Press to start recording, press again to stop

### Can I use different modes for different apps?

Yes. **App-Aware Context** (Phase 3) lets you configure default modes per application. For example:
- Terminal → Prompt Mode
- Mail → Clean Mode
- Notes → Structure Mode
- VS Code → Code Mode

### Does VaulType have voice commands?

Yes (Phase 4). You can:
- Launch and switch between apps: *"Open Safari"*, *"Switch to Terminal"*
- Manage windows: *"Move window to left half"*
- Control system: *"Volume up"*, *"Mute"*, *"Do Not Disturb on"*
- Chain commands: *"Open Terminal and run npm start"*
- Create custom aliases: *"Deploy"* → run your deploy script

## Models & Performance

### Which Whisper model should I use?

| Model | Speed | Accuracy | Best For |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| **tiny** | Fastest | Good enough | Quick notes, Intel Macs |
| **base** | Fast | Good | General use on Intel |
| **small** | Balanced | Very good | **Recommended for most users** |
| **medium** | Slower | Excellent | Accuracy-critical, long dictation |
| **large-v3** | Slowest | Best | Maximum accuracy, M-series Pro/Max |

> 💡 **Start with `small`** — it's the sweet spot of speed and accuracy for Apple Silicon.

### Which LLM should I use for post-processing?

| Model | Size | Speed | Quality |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| **Qwen2.5-3B Q4** | 2 GB | Fast | **Recommended** |
| **Phi-3.5-mini Q4** | 2.5 GB | Fast | Great for English |
| **Llama-3.2-3B Q4** | 2 GB | Fast | Good multilingual |

### How fast is transcription?

On Apple Silicon with Metal GPU acceleration:

| Model | 5s Audio | 30s Audio |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| tiny | ~0.3s | ~1.5s |
| base | ~0.5s | ~2.5s |
| small | ~1.0s | ~5s |
| medium | ~3s | ~15s |
| large-v3 | ~8s | ~40s |

*Measured on M1 MacBook Pro. M2/M3 are ~20-40% faster.*

### Can I use Ollama instead of built-in llama.cpp?

Yes. VaulType supports Ollama as an alternative LLM backend via its localhost REST API (port 11434). This is useful if you already have Ollama installed with models downloaded.

Configure in Settings > Advanced > LLM Backend > Ollama.

## Troubleshooting

### Text isn't appearing after I dictate

Most common causes:
1. **Accessibility permission not granted** — Check System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
2. **Cursor not in a text field** — Click into an editable area first
3. **Wrong injection method** — Try switching between CGEvent and Clipboard in Settings > Advanced

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](/docs/operations/troubleshooting/) for detailed solutions.

### The app says "No model loaded"

You need to download a Whisper model:
1. Open VaulType Settings > Models
2. Click Download next to a model (recommended: `small`)
3. Wait for the download to complete

### Dictation is slow

Try these in order:
1. Use a smaller model (tiny or base)
2. Ensure Metal GPU is enabled (Settings > Advanced)
3. Close GPU-intensive apps
4. Use push-to-talk for shorter recordings

### VaulType doesn't appear in the menu bar

1. Check if VaulType is running: look in Activity Monitor
2. Relaunch from `/Applications/VaulType.app`
3. Check System Settings > Control Center > Menu Bar Only to ensure it's not hidden

### Audio level meter shows no activity

1. Verify microphone permission is granted
2. Select the correct input device in Settings > Audio
3. Check that the microphone works in Voice Memos

## Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guide

VaulType follows the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) with these project conventions:

**Enforced via SwiftLint:**

```yaml
# .swiftlint.yml
opt_in_rules:
  - closure_spacing
  - empty_count
  - explicit_init
  - fatal_error_message
  - first_where
  - implicitly_unwrapped_optional
  - modifier_order
  - multiline_arguments
  - multiline_parameters
  - operator_usage_whitespace
  - overridden_super_call
  - private_outlet
  - prohibited_super_call
  - redundant_nil_coalescing
  - sorted_imports
  - unneeded_parentheses_in_closure_argument
  - vertical_parameter_alignment_on_call

disabled_rules:
  - trailing_whitespace

line_length:
  warning: 120
  error: 150

type_body_length:
  warning: 300
  error: 500

function_body_length:
  warning: 50
  error: 100

identifier_name:
  min_length: 2
  max_length: 50
  excluded:
    - id
    - x
    - y
    - i

excluded:
  - vendor/
  - build/
  - .build/
```

### Key Conventions

```swift
// 1. Use async/await, not completion handlers
// GOOD
func transcribe(audio: [Float]) async throws -> String

// BAD
func transcribe(audio: [Float], completion: @escaping (Result<String, Error>) -> Void)

// 2. Use structured concurrency
// GOOD
let result = try await whisperService.transcribe(audio: audioData)

// BAD
Task.detached { ... }  // Avoid unless you have a specific reason

// 3. Use os_log, not print
// GOOD
Logger.whisper.info("Transcription completed in \(elapsed)ms")

// BAD
print("Transcription completed in \(elapsed)ms")

// 4. Use early returns
// GOOD
guard let model = selectedModel else {
    Logger.whisper.error("No model selected")
    return
}

// BAD
if let model = selectedModel {
    // deeply nested code...
}

// 5. Mark protocol conformances in extensions
// GOOD
extension WhisperService: TranscriptionService {
    func transcribe(...) { }
}

// BAD (don't put conformance in the main declaration for large protocols)
class WhisperService: TranscriptionService { ... }
```

## Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers. The process:

1. Update version in Xcode (CFBundleShortVersionString + CFBundleVersion)
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a release tag: `git tag v0.X.0`
4. Push the tag: `git push origin v0.X.0`
5. CI automatically builds, signs, notarizes, and creates a GitHub Release

> See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](/docs/deployment/deployment/) for the full release pipeline.
